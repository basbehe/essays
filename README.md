# Into the Mummyverse, or There Are Sixteen Of These Things And None Of Them Are Good

The semi-recent flop of Universal's *The Mummy (2017)*, which killed the planned "Dark Universe" of interconnected classic horror reboots before it could even begin, brought the 1999 version to the minds of many. At the beginning of this year, I decided, on a whim, to watch through all three of these reboot movies, and then set it in my head to watch every single film in the Mummy franchise before capping it off with 2017. What I did not realize until I began, however, was that there were many more films than it first appeared. Over a dozen, in fact. Since I was living on my own at the time and needed something to do to keep myself sane, I perservered. Now it is my albatross to share with the world. I have sorted the films into their continuities, as I have analyzed them, and will present them thus.

## Where it All Begins: Prime Universe
**Includes: *The Mummy (1932)***

Here lies the beginnings of all our problems. Boris Karloff stars at the titular mummy, Imhotep, seeking to resurrect his fallen lover Ankh-su-namun. The film established numerous conventions that appear throughout the franchise: there is a love story broken by death, a person defying it for the sake of love, and a woman with some biological connection that makes them a proxy for the deceased woman. It also contains the villification of cats, a far cry from their role in the later reboot.

## Yes, There Were Sequels: Kharis Continuity
**Includes: *The Mummy’s Hand (1940), The Mummy’s Tomb (1942), The Mummy’s Ghost (1944), The Mummy’s Curse (1944)***

These films come from the era of universal rapidly cranking out sequels, making it strangely the longest-running mainline *The Mummy* series yet. The first film is a reboot of the original, while the following take place in America an increasing number of years after the first. An oddity of this series, from which it derives its name, is that Imhotep and Ankh-su-namun have been renamed "Kharis" and "Ananka" respectively. It also introduces the idea of "tana leaves" as an animating force for the mummy rather than the Book of the Dead.

## Bear With Me Here: Abbott & Costello
**Includes: *Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy (1955)***

This film has the unique phenomenon of existing as part of its own, separate Universal canon. The duo also met ==Frankenstein=={Q306791}, ==the Invisible Man=={Q759335}, ==Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde=={Q1121579}, and ==the Killer=={Q2648461} before their retirement from films. Again, bafflingly, the names have been changed once again to "Klaris" and "Ara." Besides that, the content is much what one would expect in a 1950s comedy film, with no particular stand-out moments.

## Your Childhood (Sort of): Scorpion-Reboot
**Includes: *The Mummy (1999), The Mummy Returns (2001), The Scorpion King (2002), The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008), The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior (2008), The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption (2012), The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power (2015), The Scorpion King: Book of Souls (2018)***

While the timeline grows increasingly erratic throughout the Scorpion King films, I still choose to place them in the same universe unless proven otherwise. However, for the sake of neatness, this section will be divided between the two sets of films.

__The Mummy Reboot__
This series is, most likely, what the average millenial or Gen-Z thinks of when they hear "the Mummy." Here, we see the return of the names Imhotep and Ankh-su-namun, as well as the Book of the Dead. However, the story owes much more of its plot to *The Mummy's Hand* and its series: the more action-based theming, the comedic tone, and the time period are all taken from this work. In recent years, *The Mummy (1999)* has garnered a reputation as a "bisexual icon" or "bi awakening" film, due to an attractive cast of main characters. I wish I could live in the same realm of blissful ignorance as these people, but it is not to be. Any potential eye-candy moments are wrecked by the constant reminder of how much racism the films contain. The anti-Arab sentiment is nauseatingly constant through the first two, and possibly only absent from the final only by virtue of taking place in China. Unfortunately, the version of the film which exists in one's head is much better than the one that exists in reality.

__The Scorpion King__
A direct-to-DVD series inspired by the Rock's CGI girtablullû appearance in *The Mummy Returns*, although he only stars as the titular character in the first one (with the series having four actor changes in five movies). Unfortunately, while the quality and increasing absurdity of its premise could lead it to being "so bad its good," each film has elements that (for me; your mileage may vary) turn it into a slog more than anything else. It is, however, highly recommended as a series for you and a group of fellow historians to vivisect at a party.

## Nobody's Favorite: Dark Universe
**Includes: *The Mummy (2017)***

Here lies the most recent mainstream *The Mummy* film, and all of its never-realized siblings in the Dark Universe. Infamously, its trailer was originally posted [missing multiple layers of audio mixing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRqxyqjpOHs), and things did not improve from there. Much of its audience could see it only through the lens of its 1999 predecessor and found it lacking. If you were sad to see the Dark Universe go, I recommend watching *The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003).* It isn't good either, but it is fun.
