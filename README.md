# Into the Mummyverse, or There Are Sixteen Of These Things And None Of Them Are Good

The semi-recent flop of Universal's *The Mummy (2017)*, which killed the planned "Dark Universe" of interconnected classic horror reboots before it could even begin,

## Where it All Begins: Prime Universe

**Includes: *The Mummy (1932)***

## Yes, There Were Sequels: Kharis Continuity
**Includes: *The Mummy’s Hand (1940), The Mummy’s Tomb (1942), The Mummy’s Ghost (1944), The Mummy’s Curse (1944)***


An oddity of this series, from which it derives its name, is that Imhotep and Ankh-su-namun have been renamed "Kharis" and "Ananke" respectively.

## Bear With Me Here: Abbott & Costello
**Includes: *Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy (1955)***

Again, bafflingly, the names have been changed once again to "Klaris" and "Ara."

This film has the unique phenomenon of existing as part of its own, separate Universal canon. The duo also met ==Frankenstein=={Q306791}, ==the Invisible Man=={Q759335}, ==Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde=={Q1121579}, and ==the Killer=={Q2648461} before their retirement from films.

## Your Childhood (Sort of): Scorpion-Reboot

**Includes: *The Mummy (1999), The Mummy Returns (2001), The Scorpion King (2002), The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008), The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior (2008), The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption (2012), The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power (2015), The Scorpion King: Book of Souls (2018)***

While the timeline grows increasingly erratic throughout the Scorpion King films, I still choose to place them in the same universe unless proven otherwise. However, for the sake of neatness, this section will be divided between the two sets of films.

__The Mummy Reboot__
This series is, most likely, what the average millenial or Gen-Z thinks of when they hear "the Mummy."

In recent years, *The Mummy (1999)* has garnered a reputation as a "bisexual icon" or "bi awakening" film, due to an attractive cast of main characters. I wish I could live in the same realm of blissful ignorance as these people, but it is not to be. Any potential eye-candy moments are wrecked by the constant reminder of how much racism the films contain. The anti-Arab sentiment is nauseatingly constant through the first two, and possibly only absent from the final only by virtue of taking place in China.

__The Scorpion King__

Here, we see the return of the names Imhotep and Ankh-su-namun, 

## Nobody's Favorite: Dark Universe
**Includes: *The Mummy (2017)***

Infamously, its trailer was originally posted [missing multiple layers of audio mixing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRqxyqjpOHs)
