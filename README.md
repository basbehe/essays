# Into the Mummyverse, or There Are Sixteen Of These Things And None Of Them Are Good

The semi-recent flop of Universal's *The Mummy (2017)*, which killed the planned "Dark Universe" of interconnected classic horror reboots before it could even begin, brought the

## Where it All Begins: Prime Universe

**Includes: *The Mummy (1932)***
Here lies the beginnings of all our problems. Boris Karloff stars at the titulat mummy, Imhotep

## Yes, There Were Sequels: Kharis Continuity
**Includes: *The Mummy’s Hand (1940), The Mummy’s Tomb (1942), The Mummy’s Ghost (1944), The Mummy’s Curse (1944)***

These films come from the era of universal rapidly cranking out An oddity of this series, from which it derives its name, is that Imhotep and Ankh-su-namun have been renamed "Kharis" and "Ananka" respectively. It also introduces the idea of "tana leaves" as an animating force for the mummy rather than the Book of the Dead.

## Bear With Me Here: Abbott & Costello
**Includes: *Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy (1955)***

Again, bafflingly, the names have been changed once again to "Klaris" and "Ara."

This film has the unique phenomenon of existing as part of its own, separate Universal canon. The duo also met ==Frankenstein=={Q306791}, ==the Invisible Man=={Q759335}, ==Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde=={Q1121579}, and ==the Killer=={Q2648461} before their retirement from films.

## Your Childhood (Sort of): Scorpion-Reboot

**Includes: *The Mummy (1999), The Mummy Returns (2001), The Scorpion King (2002), The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008), The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior (2008), The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption (2012), The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power (2015), The Scorpion King: Book of Souls (2018)***

While the timeline grows increasingly erratic throughout the Scorpion King films, I still choose to place them in the same universe unless proven otherwise. However, for the sake of neatness, this section will be divided between the two sets of films.

__The Mummy Reboot__
This series is, most likely, what the average millenial or Gen-Z thinks of when they hear "the Mummy." Here, we see the return of the names Imhotep and Ankh-su-namun, as well as the Book of the Dead. However, the story owes much more of its plot to *The Mummy's Hand* and its series: the more action-based theming, the comedic tone, and the time period are all taken from this work. In recent years, *The Mummy (1999)* has garnered a reputation as a "bisexual icon" or "bi awakening" film, due to an attractive cast of main characters. I wish I could live in the same realm of blissful ignorance as these people, but it is not to be. Any potential eye-candy moments are wrecked by the constant reminder of how much racism the films contain. The anti-Arab sentiment is nauseatingly constant through the first two, and possibly only absent from the final only by virtue of taking place in China. Unfortunately, the version of the film which exists in one's head is much better than the one that exists in reality.

__The Scorpion King__
A direct-to-DVD series inspired by the Rock's CGI girtablullû appearance in *The Mummy Returns*, although he only stars as the titular character in the first one (with the series having four actor changes in five movies). Unfortunately, while the quality and increasing absurdity of its premise could lead it to being "so bad its good," each film has elements that (for me; your mileage may vary) turn it into a slog more than anything else. It is, however, highly recommended as a series for you and a group of fellow historians to vivisect at a party.

## Nobody's Favorite: Dark Universe
**Includes: *The Mummy (2017)***

Here lies the most recent mainstream *The Mummy* film, and all of its never-realized siblings in the Dark Universe. Infamously, its trailer was originally posted [missing multiple layers of audio mixing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRqxyqjpOHs), and things did not improve from there. Much of its audience could see it only through the lens of its 1999 predecessor and found it lacking.
