# Into the Mummyverse, or There Are Sixteen Of These Things And None Of Them Are Good

The semi-recent flop of Universal's *The Mummy (2017)*, which killed the planned "Dark Universe" of interconnected classic horror reboots before it could even begin,

**Where it All Begins: Prime Universe**

>*The Mummy (1932)*

**Yes, There Were Sequels: Kharis Continuity**
>*The Mummy’s Hand (1940), The Mummy’s Tomb (1942), The Mummy’s Ghost (1944), *The Mummy’s Curse (1944)*


An oddity of this series, from which it derives its name, is that Imhotep and Ankh-su-namun have been renamed "Kharis" and "Ananke" respectively.

**Bear With Me Here: Abbott & Costello**
>*Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy (1955)*

This film has the unique phenomenon of existing as part of its own, separate Universal canon. The duo also met ==Frankenstein=={Q306791}, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and the Killer.

**Your Childhood (Sort of): Scorpion-Reboot**
>*The Mummy (1999), The Mummy Returns (2001), The Scorpion King (2002), The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008), The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior (2008), The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption (2012), The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power (2015), The Scorpion King: Book of Souls (2018)*

While the timeline grows increasingly erratic throughout the Scorpion King films, I still choose to place them in the same universe unless proven otherwise. However, for the sake of neatness, this section will be divided between the two sets of films.
